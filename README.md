postgres denies login after successful setup and operation after a few days
I am using pgAdmin3 LTS by BigSQL and am currently being denied entry. The password has been checked and double checked. Recently, this happened and I de-installed postgres then started from ground zero. In the process I set the password to the current value and placed it also in a secure vault for safekeeping. For a few days, it ran fine, giving me total access. Today, I am being refused.
